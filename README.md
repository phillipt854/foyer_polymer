### forcefield_clp: A foyer forcefield for mbuild_clp model
 * This forcefield is for the mbuild topology created by mBuild_polymer (github.com/phillpt854/mBuild_polymer), coarse-grained Poly(4-vinylphenol) [pvph] and Poly(2-vinylpyridine [pvpy] model created within MoSDeF framework.

#### Additional Notes:
Due to the limitation of foyer's application, care needs to be given that all units in a written-out .top file is, regardless of the indicated units in file, in reduced unit.
The write_to_lammps method in mbuild is able to handle the reduced unites ('lj unit') correctly given the appropriate arguments.
